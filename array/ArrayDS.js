/**
 An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. 
 In an array, A, of size N, each memory location has some unique index,i (where 0 <= i < N), that can be referenced as A[i] or Ai.
 Reverse an array of integers.

* Example
A = [1,2,3]
Return [3,2,1]

/*
 * Complete the 'reverseArray' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
 * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY a as parameter.
